# Flexible RAG-Enabled Assistant
The purpose of this project is to experiment with making a RAG-enabled (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI assistant.

The user can provide links to resources, as well as a base prompt. The assistant will use these, along with the chat history to generate its answers.
